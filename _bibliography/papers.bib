  abstract = "In oncology, liquid biopsy is of major relevance from theranostic 
      point of view. The searching for mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in 
      case of colorectal cancers (CRCs) allows the optimization of patient care. In 
      this context, independent of mutation status biomarkers are required for its 
      detection to confirm the presence of ctDNA in liquid biopsies. Indeed, the 
      hypermethylation of NPY and WIF1 genes appear to be an ideal biomarker for the 
      specific detection of ctDNA in CRCs. The objective of this work is to develop the 
      research of hypermethylation of NPY and WIF1 by Crystal Digital PCR™ for the 
      detection of ctDNA in CRCs. METHODS: Detection of hypermethylated NPY and WIF1 
      was developed on Cristal digital PCR™. Biological validation was performed from a 
      local cohort of 22 liquid biopsies and 23 tissue samples from patients with CRC. 
      These patients were treated at the University Hospital of Besancon (France). 
      RESULTS: The local cohort study confirmed that NPY and WIF1 were significantly 
      hypermethylated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (WIF1 
      p < 0.001; NPY p < 0.001; non-parametric Wilcoxon paired-series test). 
      Histological characteristics, tumor stages or mutation status were not correlated 
      to the methylation profiles. On the other hand, hypermethylation of NPY or WIF1 
      in liquid biopsy had a 95.5% [95%CI 77-100%] sensitivity and 100% [95%CI 69-100%] 
      specificity. CONCLUSION: Using Crystal digital PCR™, this study shows that 
      hypermethylation of NPY and WIF1 are constant specific biomarkers of CRCs 
      regardless of a potential role in carcinogenesis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a public health issue and was the third leading 
      cause of cancer-related death worldwide in 2022. Early diagnosis can improve 
      prognosis, making screening a central part of colorectal cancer management. 
      Blood-based screening, diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer patients are 
      possible with the study of cell-free circulating tumor DNA. This study aimed to 
      identify novel DNA methylation biomarkers of colorectal cancer that can be used 
      for the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: A DNA methylation 
      profile was established in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (n = 507) 
      using bioinformatics analysis and subsequently confirmed using The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas (TCGA) database (n = 348). The in silico profile was then validated on 
      local tissue and cell-free DNA samples using methylation-specific digital PCR in 
      colorectal cancer patients (n = 35) and healthy donors (n = 35). RESULTS: The DNA 
      methylation of COL25A1 and METAP1D was predicted to be a colorectal cancer 
      biomarker by bioinformatics analysis (ROC AUC = 1, 95% CI [0.999-1]). The two 
      biomarkers were confirmed with tissue samples, and the combination of COL25A1 and 
      METAP1D yielded 49% sensitivity and 100% specificity for cell-free DNA. 
      CONCLUSION: Bioinformatics analysis of public databases revealed COL25A1 and 
      METAP1D DNA methylation as clinically applicable liquid biopsies DNA methylation 
      biomarkers. The specificity implies an excellent positive predictive value for 
      follow-up, and the high sensitivity and relative noninvasiveness of a blood-based 
      test make these biomarkers compatible with colorectal cancer screening. However, 
      the clinical impact of these biomarkers in colorectal cancer screening and 
      follow-up needs to be established in further prospective studies.",

abstract = "The dynamics of colorectal epigenetics within the adenoma stages of oncogenesis 
      remain undocumented. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation dynamics in 
      colorectal cancer oncogenesis from non-tumor colon tissue to low-grade, 
      high-grade adenoma and adenocarcinoma. The methylome of 12 low-grade and 19 
      high-grade colorectal adenomas was determined via the EPIC v1 Human Methylation 
      BeadChip. These methylation profiles were complemented with the methylomes of 206 
      non-tumor colon and 22 colon adenocarcinoma samples from the GEO and TCGA 
      databases. Differentially methylated CpGs were identified via Student's t test 
      and used to monitor the evolution of the colon methylome during oncogenesis. The 
      differentially methylated promoters were used to infer the associated biological 
      process via gene ontology and the evolution of the methylation of 34 described 
      colorectal cancer DNA methylation biomarkers was explored. A total of 11.9% of 
      the colon methylome was significantly altered (q < 10(- 4)) during oncogenesis, 
      with half corresponding to DNA demethylation. Of which, 67.4% occurred during the 
      transition from non-tumor colon tissue to low-grade adenoma. A total of 9% of the 
      DNA methylation changes were specific to low-grade and/or high-grade adenomas. 
      The biological pathways related to the sensory perception of odor and stimulus 
      were hypomethylated early, nucleic acid metabolic process were methylated early, 
      post-transcriptional regulation were transiently hypomethylated and mitotic cell 
      cycle were transiently methylated. Twenty-one out of 34 the biomarkers were 
      methylated in low-grade adenomas and 11 out of 34 in high-grade adenomas. This 
      suggests that they could be used to distinguish stages of oncogenesis. This study 
      provides insight into the dynamics of colonic epigenetics during oncogenesis, 
      with early DNA methylation changes in low-grade adenomas associated with 
      transient DNA methylation changes. However, the causality of these changes 
      remains to be elucidated. This study also explores the evolution of known 
      biomarkers and their clinical applications for indirectly asserting the tumor's 
      stage.",
